# **What is Optical flow and Why?**

Optical flow is a technique used to describe image motion. It is usually applied to a series of images that have a small time step between them, for example, video frames. 
Optical flow calculates a velocity for points within the images, and provides an estimation of where points could be in the next image sequence.

Application: Optical flow was used by robotics researchers in many areas such as: object detection and tracking, image dominant plane extraction, movement detection, robot navigation and visual odometry.
